# CS-300 8-1 Journal 
While working on these projects, I focused on solving how to store, search, and display caurse information efficiently using different types of data structures. Project One helped me to understand the run-time and memory trade-offs between vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees. Project Two let apply this knowledge by building a working program that loads course data and prints it in alphanumeric order. 

My approach was to break each task down into small individual steps and choose the data structure that made the most sense performance wise. This helped me to see how much the structure that we choose can affect speed, memory, and how easy the program is to maintain. When I ran into issues, which was mostly with the file parsing and validating prerequisites, I used print statements and backtracked to find where things were going wrong. 

Working through these projects has changed how I will design software in the future. I am more aware of efficiency and organization before writing any code and I think more about how to keep my program readable and adpatable. Writing cleaner functions and consistent structure made it easier to debug and update my work. Overall, these projects definitely strengthened my ability to choose the right tools and write code that has better scalability.
